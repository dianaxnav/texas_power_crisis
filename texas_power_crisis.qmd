# The Texas Power Crisis

In this analysis, my objectives are to assess the extent of power outages in Houston caused by the first two storms that occurred in 2021, and explore whether socioeconomic indicators can serve as predictive factors for the recovery of communities following a power outage.

## Background

Leaving millions without access to electricity, Texas faced historic low temperatures in 2021 on February 10-11, 13-17, and 15-20. ^1^ Neighborhoods across Houston and other cities had no access to electricity, but lower income households bared the heaviest burden. The Texas Tribune pointed out that Black and Hispanic neighborhoods were disproportionately effected because they tended to occupy homes that were older and contained bad insulation. ^2^ Understanding whether socioeconomic factors were a reason for power outages lasting longer in certain areas could explain why lower income households seemed to be hit harder than wealthier households.

#### Highlights:

-   load vector/raster data
-   simple raster operations
-   simple vector operations
-   spatial joins

## Data Access

This analysis relies on remotely-sensed night lights data obtained from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi satellite, specifically utilizing the VNP46A1 dataset. The primary objective is to discern variations in night lights pre and post a storm event, while focusing on specific regions experiencing power outages.

To quantify the extent of residential power loss, I will spatially join the affected areas with OpenStreetMap information encompassing buildings and road networks.

I will also explore the potential socioeconomic influences on the recovery process. This will involve linking data sourced from the United States Census Bureau.

#### Night lights

Multiple days had too much cloud cover, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.

VIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.

#### Roads

To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, I will ignore areas near highways because they usually account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)).

Using [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shape file of all highways in Texas and preparing a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area will allow for the removal of the interfering data near highways. 

-   `gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg`

#### Houses

Through downloading from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area, I am also able to obtain building data from OpenStreetMap.\

-   `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg`

#### Socioeconomic

Since I am unable to access exact socioeconomic information from each home, I am using the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS ["file geodatabase"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file. The geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes.

## Vizualizing the locations of blackouts.

##### Combining the data

In this section, I am reading in night lights tiles and combining the tiles into a single `stars` object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16).

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#load in all the possible libraries i may use 
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
library(tmap)
library(geodata)
library(stars)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

#Read in the data using read_stars package
night1 <- read_stars("data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif")

night2 <- read_stars("data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif")

night3 <- read_stars("data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif")

night4 <- read_stars("data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif")

#combine all the objects into two stars object divided by data

#02/07 data
stars7 <- st_mosaic(night1, night2)

#02/16 data
stars16 <- st_mosaic(night3, night4)
```

##### Creating a Blackout Mask by Vectorizing and Cropping

In order to create the blackout mask to vectorize and crop, I am:

-   finding the change in night lights intensity caused by the storm

-   reclassifying the difference raster, assuming that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ experienced a blackout

-   assigning `NA` to all locations that experienced a drop of *less* than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^

-   Vectorizing the mask and fixing any invalid geoms

-   defining the Houston metropolitan area by using the following coordinates

    -   (-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29)

-   cropping the blackout mask to our region of interest

```{r include=TRUE, warning = F, message = F}
#find the difference
int_diff = (stars7 - stars16)

#reclass of difference raster
int_reclass <- cut(x = int_diff, 
                   breaks = c(200,Inf),
                   labels = "blackout")

#vectorize the blackout mask 
vect_mask <- st_as_sf(int_reclass) %>% 
  st_make_valid(int_reclass) #fix any invalid geoms

#define houston metro code
houston_coords <- matrix(c(-96.5, 29, -96.5, 30.5, -94.5, 30.5, -94.5, 29, -96.5, 29), 
                         ncol = 2, 
                         byrow = TRUE)

# Create a polygon from the coordinates
houston_poly <- st_polygon(list(houston_coords)) %>% 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326) #simple feature and assign CRS

#crop the blackout mask to our region of interest 
houston_blackout <- st_crop(vect_mask, houston_poly) %>% 
  st_transform(3083)#reproject the data to EPSG:3083 
```

*I defined the Houston area by the coordinates using a matrix. Using st_polygon, I was able to use the Houston coordinates to create the polygons data, however, `st_polygon` can not compute a matrix, so I turned it into a list when applying the `st_polygon`. I then used the `st_crop` function to subset the blackout mask to Houston polygon data and then re-projected. I plotted after to make sure the blackout data had layered over the houston coordinates correctly.*

##### Exclude the highways

Now, I am defining SQL query and identifying areas within 200m of all highways and finding areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway.

```{r, warning = F, message = F,  results='hide'}
#still need to define query
query <- "SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'"

#load the highway data 
highways <- st_read("data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg", query = query) %>% 
  st_transform(3083)#transform the data to EPSG 

#find the highways within 200 meters
highways_200 <- highways %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = 200) %>% 
  st_union()

#this is the area of blackouts thats are further than 200m
highways_more200 <- st_difference(houston_blackout, highways_200)

```

*I was able to identify all the highway data within 200m using `st_buffer` to adjust distance and `st_union` to dissolve the buffers.After plotting the highway data, I was able to see a clear outline of Houston highways. Next, I wanted to locate the homes outside the 200m distance from the highway to minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic. I was able to use `st_difference` to find the part Houston blackout data that does not intersect with the highway_more200 data. In the plot you can see the slight difference in data.*

#### Find homes impacted by blackouts

##### Load the buildings data using an SQL query

To find the homes within blackout areas, I am filtering to homes within them and counting the number of impacted homes.

```{r, warning = F, message = F,  results='hide'}
query1 <-"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')"

#read in the data 
residential <- st_read("data/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg", query = query1) %>% 
  st_transform(3083)#transform the data to 3083

#join residential to highway data (further than 200, )
residential_in_blackout <- st_filter(residential, highways_more200, .predicate = st_intersects)

# Count the number of impacted homes
impacted_homes <- nrow(residential_in_blackout)

#print the number of homes 
print(impacted_homes)
```

*According to the data, there are 157,410 homes impacted by the blackout. I was able to use the `st_filter` function to find homes that intersect with residential geom data and areas that blacked out further than 200m from the highway. I used the function `nrow` to determine the number of values in the column to give me the number of impacted homes*

#### Investigating socioeconomic factors

##### Loading ACS data

```{r, warning =F, message = F,  results='hide'}
#read in the geodatabase layers 
st_layers("data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb")

#using st_read load the geom data 
geodata_geoms <- st_read("data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb", layer = "ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS") %>% 
  st_transform(3083)

#using st_read load the income data  
geodata_income <- st_read("data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb", layer = "X19_INCOME") %>% select("B19013e1", "GEOID") #select only the median income field

```

##### Determining which census tracts experienced blackouts:

Finding the census tracts that involved blackouts by:

-   joining the income data to the census tract geometries

-   spatially joining census tract data with buildings determined to be impacted by blackouts\

```{r, warning = F, message = F,  results='hide'}
#rename the column to join 
geodata_econ <- geodata_income %>% 
       rename("GEOID_Data" = "GEOID")

#use left join to join the data to the census tract geometries
income_ctg <- left_join(geodata_geoms, geodata_econ)

#spatially join to find the number of data 
spatial_income1 <- st_join(residential_in_blackout, income_ctg, by = st_intersects)

#spat_income<- st_join(residential_in_blackout, income_ctg)
cen_num <- unique(spatial_income1$NAMELSAD)

length(cen_num)
```

*In order to correctly join the geodata base layer geometry with the income data, I used a `left_join`, but for this to work there has to be a similar column name with which it will join by. I used the `rename()` function to the `GEOID` column to be the same as in the geometry data. After, I was able to spatially join the data using `st_join` to the `residential_in_blackout` data and `income_ctg` which joins the data based off intersecting geometries. I then did the `unique()` function to find the number of census tracts that had black outs and the length of these numbers was 754.*

##### Comparing incomes of impacted tracts to unimpacted tracts

This section involves visualizing the data by :

-   creating a map of median income by census tracts displaying which tracts had blackouts

-   plotting the distribution of income in impacted and unimpacted tracts\

```{r,warning = F, message = F}
#create a map of median income by census tract, designating which tracts had blackouts
#subset data to plot the census tract geoms
spatial_income <- income_ctg[residential_in_blackout, ]

#plot the first data where it is just the census tract geometries with houston coordinates (so it prints all of Houston)-unfiltered
map1 <- tm_shape(income_ctg, bbox = st_bbox(highways_more200)) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "B19013e1", title = "Median Income($)",palette = "mako") #adjust the legend

#layer over the spatial_income data that contains both the tract geoms and residential blackout data
map1 + tm_shape(spatial_income) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "B19013e1", palette = "mako", legend.show = FALSE)+
  tm_borders(col = "orange") +
  tm_compass() +
  tm_scalebar() +
  tm_title("Median Income by Census Tracts") +
  tm_graticules()+
  tm_ylab("Longitude") +
  tm_xlab("Latitude")#label 

```

```{r, warning=F, message = F}
#plot the distribution of income in impacted and unimpacted tracts
#convert this frame to 3083
income_ctg <- income_ctg %>% 
  st_transform(3083)
#convert this polygon to 3083
houston_poly <- houston_poly %>% 
  st_transform(3083)
#crop the income data to houston polygon data 
houston_census <- st_crop(income_ctg, houston_poly)
#unimpacted data that shows census tracts not in spatial income
unimpacted <- houston_census %>% 
  filter(!GEOID_Data %in% spatial_income$GEOID_Data)

#impacted data that shows census tracts in spatial income 
impacted <- houston_census %>% 
  filter(GEOID_Data %in% spatial_income$GEOID_Data)

#check to make sure that it was the same 
nrow(impacted)== length(unique(spatial_income1$NAMELSAD))

#unimpacted plot
unimpacted1 <- ggplot(unimpacted) + 
  geom_histogram((aes(x = B19013e1)), color = "white", fill = "navy") +
  labs(subtitle = "Unimpacted Homes by Blackout", size = 1,
       x = "Income", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()#customize and label 
#impacted plot
impacted1 <-ggplot(impacted) +
  geom_histogram((aes(x = B19013e1)), color = "white", fill = "navy")+
  labs(subtitle = "Impacted Homes by Blackout", size = 1, 
       x = "Income", y = "Count")+
  theme_minimal()#customize and label 
  
#join them together side by side and label the title 
impacted1+unimpacted1+plot_annotation("Census Tract Income Distribution")
```

## **Conclusions:**

**The result above shows interesting tract geoms within the area of Houston, Texas. The map plotted by median income shows the census tracts which were affected by the blackout and shows us that relatively lower income homes (\$0-\$50,000) were most affected by the blackout. You could see that it is mostly concentrated in the inner city. In the distribution data, you could see that both have a similar skewed relationship. The limitations to this study rely mostly on the fact that income data is mostly voluntary and not each household participates in the census surveys provided by the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.**
